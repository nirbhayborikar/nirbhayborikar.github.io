I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechatronics at Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten, specializing in Robotics, Computer Vision, and Automation Engineering. My passion lies in developing robotic and intelligent systems that solve real-world challenges. My academic journey started with a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, which sparked my interest in computers and programming. This natural intersection of skills guided me toward robotics, where I can blend mechanical design with software development.

Throughout my studies and hands-on projects, I have gained extensive experience working with microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and programming in Python, C++, and ROS2. I have applied this knowledge to create autonomous robots, computer vision algorithms, and AI-driven control systems. What began as a personal interest has grown into a dedicated professional pursuit fueled by my desire to innovate.

I am always eager to leverage my expertise in robotics and AI to develop solutions that add tangible value. In my free time, I continue to work on projects that have the potential to positively impact industry and society. This motivation to innovate and help others through technology drives my academic and career ambitions every day.
